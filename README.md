# Signal

A friendly music sequencer application built with web technology.

## Goals

- Cross-platform
- NOT complicated UI
- MIDI format compatible

## Concepts

Recording and finishing is the role of the DAW, making it an app that can be used quickly at the composition and sketching stages.
The following restrictions are given so that you can concentrate on composing without being distracted by the selection of sound sources and adjustment of effects.

- No high-quality sound
- No Fx
- Make it as lightweight as possible

## Contribution

Any kind of contribution is welcome.
